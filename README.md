# Introduction

## Aim of the project

The goal of this project is to provide a rough overview of typical process steps (data acquisition, data preparation, training of the ML model, execution of classification, and quality assessment) for building a simple machine learning model. This is done using the well-known and well-researched [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for handwritten digit recognition as an example.
